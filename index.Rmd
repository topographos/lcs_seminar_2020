# When ?

* Southern Palestine - 1200 BCE

* Jazireh - 800 BCE

* Northern Levant - 300 BCE

* Upper Euphrates - 400 - 600 CE

# Objectives for now ...


* What is the timing of the ‘Great Dispersal’ across the Northern Fertile Crescent?

* Was there one dispersal or many ‘dispersals’? Are these events interrelated?

* What are the processes underpinning the change?

* What are the long-term settlement trajectories in the Northern Fertile Crescent from the Iron Age to the Late Islamic period?

# Methodology

---
# How ?

_‘The question then becomes how best to mine, mix and otherwise analyse a potential embarrassment of riches’_ (Bevan, 2015)

* deluge of legacy surveys built upon **Fragile Crescent** and **CLaSS** project database
* Data Science paradigm:

  - Literate Programming (Knuth, 1983)
  
  - Open Science: open access + open methods + open data (Marwick et al, 2017)
  
  - Tool Driven Revolution (Marwick and Shmidt, 2019)

* tools of trade: PostGIS, SQL, R, QGIS, GRASS, WhiteboxTools, Git and Github

###Geographic Data Science

_'a set of statistical, computational, and analytical techniques and workflows; the set of of interconnected tools developed with such applications in mind; as well as the particular epistomological perspective that sustains these practise'_

###Literate Programming

_'By coining the phrase “literate programming”, I am imposing a moral commitment on everyone who hears the term; surely nobody wants to admit writing an illiterate program'_
